## 🕶️ Welcome, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

You have been granted **Level 7 Clearance** to access the **Marvel Multiverse Holo-Database**.  
This interface is designed to:

- Track every **film, series, one-shot, and comic** across the Marvel timelines
- Decode **variants** across different Earths (616, 838, 10005…)
- Organize your viewing history chronologically ✨

## 🚀 Mission Protocols (Features)

### 🗓️ Chronological Database

📜 Scroll through a **single, unbroken timeline** — from _Captain America’s first shield_ to _Secret Wars_.

### 🧠 Intelligent Filtering

🔍 Slice the timeline like Doctor Strange with:

- Saga → _Infinity Saga, Multiverse Saga, Mutant Saga_ - Universe → _Earth-616, Earth-838, Earth-199999, Earth-10005_ - Media → _Movies, Shows, Animation, Comics_ - Search → enter keywords like `"Avengers Assemble"` or `"Mutants"`

### 📊 Progress Tracker

✅ Mark what you’ve seen → your **Multiverse Completion %** updates.  
🎉 Confetti rains down like you just lifted Mjölnir.

### 📈 Holo-Graphs

Visualize your watch history with **Stark-tech dashboards**:

- Releases by **Decade** - Media Type **Breakdown** ![iron man HUD](images/hud.avif)

## 🌌 The Multiverse Awaits...

This isn’t just MCU (Earth-616).  
The Holo-Database maps **X-Men’s Earth-10005**, _What If...?_, and even **variants from across timelines**.

- 🖥️ **HTML5** → core structure
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** → Stark-speed styling
